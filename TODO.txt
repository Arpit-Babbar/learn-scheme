Code in tables should probably be red and not blocks (just remove the code tags)...
Need to test for code that contains incomplete definitions...
Maybe require code to be marked invalid or have a (hidden) test?

*** Section 1.1.8 needs to have exp and log defined in jsLisp!

(Ongoing...) Need to handle discontinuous programs (e.g. defining a variable in one block and using it in another)
